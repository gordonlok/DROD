# Graph Connected Reference Sets for Robust Unsupervised Scatterliers and Clusterliers Detection"
# Datasetscs
	24 demo datasets are located in the GROD/MGOD_code/data folder.
# Code information
	All codes are written in PyCharm. The functionality of each section is as follows:
	The code folder contains the code details of the GROD algorithm.
	The MGOD_modify.py file is the execution file of the entire algorithm. The SAS & LAS files are the files for evaluate anomaly index. The generate_clustlier file is a file that generate clusterlier. The other file contains some algorithms for experimental comparison.
	Just add all files to the run path and change the location where you call your dataset, then run the MGOD_modify.py file and the results will appear in the command line window.
